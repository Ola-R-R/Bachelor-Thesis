\noindent In conclusion, the differences between the covid season and the other seasons analyzed is that the home-court advantage got smaller, but it did not disappear fully. This could be that because they still played near were they lived, so they still got a boost. Where that boost could come from could differ from player to player, but the main boost could come from better sleep or better relaxation before a match. This is because they were still in their home city. Also the number of fans at a match had a positive impact on all scoring types except three-pointers and they had a positive impact on the home-court advantage. The impact an individual fan had on the home-court advantage was positive in all three scoring types, but they had a negative impact on the number of three-pointers scored. This is because during covid, they scored more three-pointers, but they had a positive impact on the other scoring types. Also, we have seen that the attacking strengths of scoring type one and two have stayed pretty consistent, but the three-points attacking strengths of every team have increased a lot.
